**Ollama** is the easiest way to get up and running with large language models such as gpt-oss, Gemma 3, DeepSeek-R1, Qwen3 and more.

1. Download and install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download)
2. Only some versions can be picked from the app list. So you will need to run a command from a terminal for specific ones, e.g. `ollama run llama3.2`
